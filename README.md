## About The Project

After completing a Intro to C/C++ course in 2015 and having visited a Casino earlier that year, I decided to implement the card game [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) *(also called **21**)* in C++. The game was my first real application of using objects, C++ streams, key-press listeners, pass-by-reference/value, collections, and windows system calls.

Features:
* Colored text and ASCII art.
* Minor use of sound (windows alerts).
* Settings menu (text speed, shoe size, starting funds)
* Scrollable rulebook (use arrow keys to traverse)
* Splitting hands (one split per round)
