## About The Project

After completing a Intro to C/C++ course in 2015 and having visited a Casino earlier that year, I decided to implement the card game [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) *(also called **21**)* in C++. The game was my first real application of using objects, C++ streams, key-press listeners, pass-by-reference/value, collections, and windows system calls.

Features:
* Colored text and ASCII art.
* Minor use of sound (windows alerts).
* Settings menu (text speed, shoe size, starting funds)
* Scrollable rulebook (use arrow keys to traverse)
* Splitting hands (one split per round)

## Download & Installation (Windows)
* Download `Blackjack.zip` from the [[Lastest Release]](https://github.com/KevinTyrrell/Blackjack/releases/latest).
* Unzip `Blackjack.zip`, usually into its own directory.
* Run `Blackjack.bat`, ensuring `Blackjack.exe` is in the same directory.
    * Alternatively, from a Bash terminal, run `Blackjack.sh`, ensuring `Blackjack.exe` is in the same directory.
