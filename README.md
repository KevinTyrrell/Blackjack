Blackjack
=========

Console-based game developed as a learning project after my first college course in C++. Spent three weeks making it polished and dynamic. The game has realistic Blackjack rules, and even supports splitting hands. Within the menus, there is a rulebook of all the 'House Rules' I have decided upon. Many of these are very reasonable and follow the common conventions of Blackjack. If there are any mistakes, please contact me at kev070892@gmail.com.
